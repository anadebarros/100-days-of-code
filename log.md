### Day 13: January 13th 2017

**Today's Progress**: 

 Continued FreeCodeCamp's Javascript section
 Started learning Ruby and RoR, along with the command line

**Thoughts:** I decided to try RoR and really liked it! Ruby is a language that is easy to grasp. I'm jut afraid I won't have time for everything but i'll keep this as my little side project I'll do while I continue my journey with Javascript. Maybe in some months without even noticing I can actually say I know ruby and Ror!

### Day 14: January 14th 2017

**Today's Progress**: 

 Continued FreeCodeCamp's Javascript section --->finished frst section
 Started learning learning React on CodeAcademy
 Learned about Node.js and all the dependencies: npm, Homebrew, webpack, babel, etc etc

**Thoughts:** With what I learnt from RoR I went and adventured myself with Node.Js and was much easier to grasp!Will have to keep digging deeper on that part, but I'm happy that I managed to install all of the million things one needs to do in the beginnind through the command line (I kept getting errors but managed to fixed them all, really proud),
React is a tool I'll be using a lot I can sense it. I like the concept so far.

**Thoughts:** marathon...algorithm challenges in FCC are really hard...I always need to research and get help for some points.. However now I'm feeling it is pushing me to think harder!
I also goofed around the web today to check some hello worlds from other programming languages. Do I want to go more into the back end side of things? Front end is feeling a lot like web design these days and that's something I don't feel I would like to do.
